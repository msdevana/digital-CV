## Objectives

## Current Research Interests

I currently study deep ocean circulation in the North Atlantic Program as a PhD student under the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP). My research examines abyssal flows across a wide range of physical and temporal scales to understand how flow varies in strength, position, and its hydrographic properties.

## Research Experience

1. **Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP)** [__2018-Present__]{style="float:right; white-space:nowrap;"}
   _Graduate Research Assistant, University of Miami_

   - Investigated mid-depth and deep ocean flows across a range of physical and temporal scales in an effort to understand various components of the flow variability and impacts on larger Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
   - Geospatial data analysis with numerous types of datasets including: high resolution time series, unstructured spatial shipboard and ARGO observations, remote sensing observations (ocean altimetry and sea surface temperature), high resolution numerical model "big data", ocean and atmosphere reanalysis products.
   - Implemented numerical simulations to supplement observational campaigns (fluid dynamics simulations and statistical models)
   - Assisted in constructing, deploying, and recovering mooring arrays with various instruments during multiple sea campaigns. Tasks involved manual construction of instrument components, calibrating instruments, data quality control and calibration post recovery
   - Collaborative work involving partners at institutions in numerous countries

2. **Internal Wave Dynamics** _Master's Student, University of Southampton_[__2015-2018__]{style="float:right"}

   - Examined high resolution hydrographic observations from the Southern Ocean to quantify internal wave activity over topographic features using spectral methods and parameterization techniques.
   - Simulated internal wave evolution by constructing a ray tracing model for 3-D evolving fields surrounding the observational site.

## Technical Skills

1. Python (Strong)
   - Experience using geospatial datasets with core earth science python packages (xarray,cartopy, dash, GMT, netcdf, numpy, scipy).
   - Developed python programs for oceanographic field work (CTD and mooring data processing, mooring trilateration, instrument calibrations).
   - Extensive experience with data visualization techniques including: matplotlib static and animated figures, interactive visualizations, geospatial visualizations, real-time data visuals, and "big-data" visualization techniques.
   - Extensive experience with time series analysis and unstructured observational data
   - Open science oriented methods including working and collaborating in jupyter notebooks and binders for data analysis.
   - Familiar with developing machine learning models for research and data analysis using Tensorflow, pyTorch, and Keras.
   - Familiar with high performance computing operations including modifying code for GPU operations and parallelization of algorithms.
2. Julia (Proficient)
   - Experience with numerical fluid dynamics simulations, geospatial and time series data analysis
3. Matlab (Strong)
4. Javascript (Proficient)
5. Proficient in Linux operating systems (experience with CentOs, Debian, and Ubuntu)
6. HTML & CSS (Proficient) - Experience responsive designing web pages and markdown documentation
